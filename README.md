Mediapipe intro learning to detect hands from camera from tutorial\
I was curious since I found years ago a video in [Advance Computer Vision With Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY&t=138s&pp=ygUQcHl0aG9uIG1lZGlhcGlwZQ%3D%3D) that talked about computer vision. Then one day I decided to check the documentation to check more about that. 

I did this simple intro-project to understand how the library mediapipe works, and how the video is capture from my webcam is activated. Once I have a clear idea of a personal project using mediapipe or other similar library I'll use this repo as a base knowledge.
